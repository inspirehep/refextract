"""
When a document is converted to plain-text from PDF,
certain characters may result in the plain-text, that are
either unwanted, or broken. These characters need to be corrected
or removed. Examples are, certain control characters that would
be illegal in XML and must be removed; TeX ligatures (etc); broken
accents such as umlauts on letters that must be corrected.
This function returns a dictionary of (unwanted) characters to look
for and the characters that should be used to replace them.
@return: (dictionary) - { seek -> replace, } or charsacters to
replace in plain-text.
